# House-Price-Prediction
The process of valuing and marketing a house is challenging. Traditional methods used by realtors 
only consider a limited number of parameters over a relatively small sample 
size, which can lead to houses being misvalued. There is also the potential for realtors 
to have an unconscious bias when valuing a property, which can be detrimental to 
prospective buyers. These shortcomings of traditional valuing techniques have presented 
the need for more advanced, accurate, and efficient methods of valuing a house. The 
purpose of this project was to take part in the House Prices- Advanced Regression 
Techniques competition. This competition involved the analysis of 79 different variables 
describing numerous aspects of houses in Ames, Iowa, and subsequently developing 
machine-learning models capable of predicting the final prices. This notebook provides a 
detailed analysis of the data and the experimentation of three different machine-
learning models, namely Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression, to investigate their 
prediction accuracy. The effect of various parameters on each model's accuracy was 
investigated, and different machine-learning tuning methods were explored.
